## :star2: About the Project

This project is the card game War, and when executed, it plays itself automatically between two players.

This was the final project of the Java section of our Back End bootcamp.

This project only uses Java for languages.

My favorite thing about this project is that it used all of the different things that we learned up to the point in class, such as if-else statements, loops, and collections.
I also enjoyed the freedom this project gave, as I was able to play around with some of the variables and turn it into a product that undeniably had my influence on it.
